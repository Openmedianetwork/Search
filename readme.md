# Open Media Network Search

On https://openworlds.info/ we run an instance of the [Searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/).

Searx is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search engines while not storing information about its users.

## Why use searx?

- searx may not offer you as personalised results as Google, but it doesn't generate a profile about you
- searx doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a third party, and it can't be used to compromise you
- searx is free software, the code is 100% open and you can help to make it better. See more on github

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe in digital freedom, make searx your default search engine.
